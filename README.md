Artificial Neural Networks are one most powerful ML/DL model, capable of solving complex problems in simliar 
to us humans. NN was found in 1958, where psychologist 		**Frank Rosenblatt**. He was the first person
who manage to implement the first NN model. These images shows the simliarity between humans NN and ML/DL ANN :
