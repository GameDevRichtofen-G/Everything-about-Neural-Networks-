# What is Artificial Neural Network
Artificial Neural Networks are one most powerful ML/DL model, capable of solving complex problems in simliar 
to us humans. NN was found in 1958, where psychologist 		**Frank Rosenblatt**. He was the first person
who manage to implement the first NN model. These images shows the simliarity between humans NN and ML/DL ANN :

# Structure
ANNs have clear and genius structure. In general they are made out multiple layers and nodes which we will talk about in the moment. 

## Neurons
an ANN consists of connected units or nodes called neurons. Each neuron/node receive inputs from connected neurons,
and then the same neuron sends an input to other connected neurons:

## Layers
ANNs are made out 3 general layer.<br/>
